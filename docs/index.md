This project came about as a way to retire an old FTP server. Sometimes clients need to send you files that are too large to attach to an email. In the past the answer was to set up an FTP server for them to upload the files too. Since then FTP has fallen out of fashion and better solutions such as Dropbox and Google Drive now exist. Unfortunately some clients just can't use Dropbox or Drive, so this was the simplest solution I could come up with.
